# Welcome to LIN-DOS ðŸš€

Hello there! If youâ€™ve spent ages in the comfy realms of Windows command line and are now facing the intriguing world of Linux, LIN-DOS is here to save your day or at least make it a heck of a lot easier!

## Why LIN-DOS?

Imagine you've been speaking English all your life and suddenly you need to order your coffee in Martian (okay, not Martian, but you get the drift).
Thatâ€™s what switching from Windows to Linux can feel like. Scary, right? LIN-DOS is like your personal translator from Windows CLI to Linux CLI. Itâ€™s here to make sure you donâ€™t miss your command line coffee!

## What's Cooking?

This repo is just getting started, and we plan to keep adding more commands and features gradually.
It's a work in progress, and the goal is to make it as comprehensive and helpful as possible. Stay tuned for updates and feel free to contribute your expertise!
The current implementation is focused on supporting **Windows CMD functionality on Ubuntu**.
